.. todo::
    * First step, cloning and demo layer (how to build it)
    * Defining our environment (simple, one UUT with a few test points)
    * Defining our first sequences (simple, have a few requires)

This document is intended to help you set up the software development environment for Frasy and its ecosystem.
After that, a simple example will show you how to define your own environment, as well as writing your own sequences of tests.
