Cloning and Presentation
========================

The first thing to do is to get a local copy of `Frasy's sources <https://github.com/smartel99/Frasy>`_:

.. code-block:: pwsh

    git clone https://github.com/smartel99/Frasy --recursive

.. important::
    Do not forget the recursive flag, as Frasy uses a few important submodules!
